# Cypress Testing: Payment Gateway Form Validation

This project demonstrates test validation using the Cypress testing tool. The tests validate the functionality of a payment gateway form on a demo site.

---

## 🚀 **Project Overview**
This Cypress project focuses on:
- Validating input fields in the payment gateway form.
- Ensuring proper error handling and form submission behavior.
- Testing the overall functionality of a demo payment gateway.

---

## 📋 **Prerequisites**
Before running the tests, ensure the following are installed:
1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
2. [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
3. [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) (v12 or later)

## 📜 **Test Details**
- **Test File**: `mytest.cy.js`
- **Scenario**: Validating the payment gateway form fields:
  - Check if email input accepts valid email formats.
  - Ensure required fields trigger validation messages when left blank.
  - Validate form submission behavior on successful and unsuccessful attempts.

---

## 🌐 **Demo Site**
The tests target the following demo site:
[https://payment.page/demo/](https://payment.page/demo/)

---

## 📌 **Known Issues**
1. The email field ID is dynamically generated, requiring the use of stable selectors (e.g., `data-*` attributes).
2. Some test cases might fail due to network delays or element visibility issues.
